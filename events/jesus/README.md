If you have any questions, or need to find us on our journey, please message your Co-Host Ethereum Jesus on Twitter or Telegram. This will be an informal and traditional style pub crawl." 
  - "The theme of this event is 'Failed Ethereum Killers & Shitcoins.'Ethereum Jesus, The-All Seeing Eye, knows you have embarrassing Shitcoin T-shirts and swag (I'm looking at you TRONIX, ExzOS, and NEO) tucked away in your closet from the many Crypto conferences you've been to over the past three years. This is your chance to finally wear them out and repent your sins with Ethereum Jesus in preparation for Serenity. Make sure you pack your swag in your suitcase before your flight! Let's get a good laugh out of all of them and have Ethereum Jesus turn your water into rice wine (sake). *If you wear an Ethereum T-Shirt you're buying me a shot.*"
