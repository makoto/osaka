synopsis:- "Proof of stake (PoS) is attracting a lot of attention these days, with Ethereum switching over from proof of work (PoW). PoS is an alternative process for transaction verification on a blockchain. Recently, it is increasing in popularity and being adopted by many cryptocurrencies, for several key reasons. PoS systems do not need to consume large amounts of energy as PoW, while still securing the network. Also, by staking one's coins, one can earn passive income from holding crypto, far more than other traditional savings methods. Many new companies are being created to help users receive income from staking or delegating coins." 
 - "Come listen to representatives from several PoS coins talk about the present and future of PoS!"
